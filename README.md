QuickLook for GeoJSON

This is a simple QuickLook plugin to browse GeoJSON files.  It matches files with the ".geojson" extension.

It's a simple web-based preview using Leaflet.js. Probably many errors and mistakes since this is my first Obj-C project. It's mostly based on TileMill's QuickLook plugin for MBTiles.
